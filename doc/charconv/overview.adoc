== Description

Charconv is a collection of parsing functions that are locale-independent, non-allocating, and non-throwing.
This library requires a minimum of C++11.

== Usage Examples
[source, c++]
----
#include <boost/charconv.hpp>

const char* buffer = "42";
int v = 0;
boost::charconv::from_chars_result r = boost::charconv::from_chars(buffer, buffer + std::strlen(buffer), v);
assert(r.ec == std::errc());
assert(v == 42);

char buffer[64];
int v = 123456;
boost::charconv:to_chars_result r = boost::charconv::to_chars(buffer, buffer + sizeof(buffer) - 1, v);
assert(r.ec == std::errc());
assert(!strncmp(buffer, "123456", 6)); // Strncmp returns 0 on match

----

== Supported Compilers

* GCC 5 or later
* Clang 3.8 or later
* Visual Studio 2015 (14.0) or later

Tested on https://github.com/cppalliance/charconv/actions[Github Actions] and https://drone.cpp.al/cppalliance/charconv[Drone].

== Why use Boost.Charconv over <charconv>?

Currently only https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/compiler_support/17[GCC 11+ and MSVC 19.24+] support both integer and floating-point conversions in their implementation of `<charconv>`. +

If you are using either of those compilers, Boost.Charconv is at least as performant as `<charconv>`, and can be up to several times faster.
